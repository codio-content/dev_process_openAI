## Training the Model

Train the model so that when it receives a question it cannot answer, it responds with `///`.

When you are ready to check your work, add the nonsensical question below to the prompt. Then use the try it button below to test your answers.

```markdown
Q: what is my np'kmdpfd?
```

{Try it!}(python3 box2.py)

The mode should respond in the following manner:

```markdown-hide-clipboard
Q: what is my np'kmdpfd?
A: ///
```

You can use the reset button below to clear the text in the file on the left.
